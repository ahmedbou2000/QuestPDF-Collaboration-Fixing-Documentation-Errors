# Fixing Documentation Error in QuestPDF

This repository documents my collaboration with the QuestPDF team to identify and resolve an error in their documentation.

## Overview

While using QuestPDF, I noticed a miscalculation in the column definitions within their documentation. Specifically, the example provided produced incorrect width calculations for the table columns. I highlighted the issue, proposed a fix, and shared my findings with the QuestPDF team. They acknowledged the error, implemented my suggestions, and updated their documentation accordingly.

## Details of the Issue

The incorrect documentation was related to column definitions for tables. The original implementation produced mismatched widths, which I analyzed and rectified. Below are the key points:
- *Issue:* The column widths did not sum correctly in the example provided by the documentation.
- *Proposed Fix:* Adjusted the column definitions to properly align constant and relative column values.

## My Contribution

1. *Identified the Problem:* Carefully reviewed the documentation and pinpointed the error in column width calculations.
2. *Proposed a Fix:* Suggested updated code to correct the column definitions.
3. *Collaboration:* Shared detailed feedback and code snippets in a GitHub discussion with the QuestPDF team.
4. *Outcome:* The QuestPDF team accepted my fix and updated their documentation, crediting my contribution.
